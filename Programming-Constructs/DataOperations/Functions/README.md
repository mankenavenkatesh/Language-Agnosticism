# Functions
- fn keyword, which allows you to declare new functions.
- the main function, which is the entry point of many programs
-  Rust doesn’t care where you define your functions, only that they’re defined somewhere.

### Naming conventions
- Rust code uses snake case as the conventional style for function and variable names.
-  In snake case, all letters are lowercase and underscores separate words.
