# Basic data types in Haskell

### Type Inference
``` 
- Python - Dynamically typed language.
- Java - Statically Typed
- Haskell - Best of both. 

Haskell being statically typed, usally not required to declare types. Instead, compiler infers then.
if n = 2+2, compiler figures out `n` is an integer.
